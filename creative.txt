My apologies, I can definitely improve on those summaries! Here
are more detailed versions: 1. "The Lord of the Rings"
by J.R.R. Tolkien: Frodo Baggins, a simple hobbit living in
the Shire, inherits the One Ring, an artifact of immense
power sought by the evil Dark Lord Sauron. This unassuming
ring holds the key to Sauron's dominion over Middle-earth, and
its destruction is crucial to stopping his reign of terror.
With the fate of the world resting on his shoulders,
Frodo embarks on a perilous journey to Mordor, Sauron's fiery
realm, where the Ring must be unmade. Along the way,
Frodo forms a fellowship of companions, each with their own
strengths and weaknesses: the wise wizard Gandalf, the noble Aragorn,
the skilled elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the loyal hobbits
Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Together, they face treacherous landscapes, monstrous
creatures, and the looming threat of Sauron's forces. They experience
loyalty, sacrifice, and loss, forging bonds that become their greatest
weapon. Beyond epic battles and fantastical creatures, the story delves
into themes of good versus evil, the corrupting influence of
power, and the importance of unwavering courage in the face
of despair. It's a timeless tale celebrating friendship, resilience, and
the small person's potential to change the world. 2. "Pride
and Prejudice" by Jane Austen: Elizabeth Bennet, a witty and
independent young woman, lives with her family in genteel poverty.
Their lives are thrown into disarray when the wealthy and
aloof Mr. Darcy arrives in their neighborhood. Their initial encounters
are marked by misunderstandings and sharp wit, leading to mutual
dislike and prejudice. As events unfold, Elizabeth learns that Darcy
isn't just arrogant but possesses hidden depths and a sense
of honor. Similarly, Darcy discovers Elizabeth's intelligence and kind heart
beneath her spirited exterior. However, societal expectations and family obligations
create obstacles to their budding love. Elizabeth must reconcile her
initial prejudice with her growing affection, while Darcy must learn
to express his feelings and overcome his pride. Through witty
dialogue and social satire, Austen paints a compelling picture of
early 19th-century England, exploring themes of class, gender roles, societal
expectations, and the complexities of love. It's a timeless story
about overcoming first impressions, recognizing true character, and finding happiness
on one's own terms. 3. "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
by Gabriel Garcia Marquez: In the fictional town of Macondo,
Colombia, the Buendía family embarks on a saga spanning seven
generations. Their tumultuous journey mirrors the town's rise and fall,
intertwining elements of magical realism with historical events. José Arcadio
Buendía, the family's patriarch, founds Macondo, driven by dreams of
creating a utopian society. His descendants experience love, loss, ambition,
and isolation, facing wars, political turmoil, and natural disasters. Some
possess magical abilities, while others grapple with loneliness and the
weight of the family's past. Macondo itself becomes a character,
thriving and decaying with the Buendías' fortunes. This cyclical narrative
explores themes of family legacies, the burdens of history, the
destructive nature of isolation, and the cyclical nature of life
and death. Through fantastical elements and vivid imagery, Garcia Marquez
creates a haunting and unforgettable story about humanity's enduring journey.

classics! ese literary classics! April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire,
stirring Dull roots with spring rain. Winter kept us warm,
covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with
dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee With
a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, And
went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, And drank coffee,
and talked for an hour. Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’
aus Litauen, echt deutsch. And when we were children, staying
at the archduke’s, My cousin’s, he took me out on
a sled, And I was frightened. He said, Marie, Marie,
hold on tight. And down we went. In the mountains,
there you feel free. I read, much of the night,
and go south in the winter. What are the roots
that clutch, what branches grow Out of this stony rubbish?
Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you
know only A heap of broken images, where the sun
beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket
no relief, And the dry stone no sound of water.
Only There is shadow under this red rock, (Come in
under the shadow of this red rock), And I will
show you something different from either Your shadow at morning
striding behind you Or your shadow at evening rising to
meet you; I will show you fear in a handful
of dust. Frisch weht der Wind Der Heimat zu Mein
Irisch Kind, Wo weilest du? ‘You gave me hyacinths first
a year ago; ‘They called me the hyacinth girl.’ —Yet
when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, Your
arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak,
and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead,
and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light,
the silence. Oed’ und leer das Meer. Madame Sosostris, famous
clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless Is known to be
the wisest woman in Europe, With a wicked pack of
cards. Here, said she, Is your card, the drowned Phoenician
Sailor, (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) Here
is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, The lady of
situations. Here is the man with three staves, and here
the Wheel, And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this
card, Which is blank, is something he carries on his
back, Which I am forbidden to see. I do not
find The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. I see
crowds of people, walking round in a ring. Thank you.
If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, Tell her I bring
the horoscope myself: One must be so careful these days.
Unreal City, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, I had
not thought death had undone so many. Sighs, short and
infrequent, were exhaled, And each man fixed his eyes before
his feet. Flowed up the hill and down King William
Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With
a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. There
I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: 'Stetson!
‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!
‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden, ‘Has
it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? ‘Or
has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? ‘Oh keep the
Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, ‘Or with his
nails he’ll dig it up again! ‘You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon

in, like a burnished throne, Glowed on the marble, where
the glass Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out (Another hid his
eyes behind his wing) Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
Reflecting light upon the table as The glitter of her
jewels rose to meet it, From satin cases poured in
rich profusion; In vials of ivory and coloured glass Unstoppered,
lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
That freshened from the window, these ascended In fattening the
prolonged candle-flames, Flung their smoke into the laquearia, Stirring the
pattern on the coffered ceiling. Huge sea-wood fed with copper
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, In
which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam. Above the antique
mantel was displayed As though a window gave upon the
sylvan scene The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale Filled all the
desert with inviolable voice And still she cried, and still
the world pursues, ‘Jug Jug’ to dirty ears. And other
withered stumps of time Were told upon the walls; staring
forms Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. Footsteps shuffled
on the stair. Under the firelight, under the brush, her
hair Spread out in fiery points Glowed into words, then
would be savagely still. ‘My nerves are bad tonight. Yes,
bad. Stay with me. Speak to me. Why do you
never speak. Speak. What are you thinking of? What thinking?
What? I never know what you are thinking. Think.’ I
think we are in rats’ alley Where the dead men
lost their bones. ‘What is that noise?’ The wind under
the door. ‘What is that noise now? What is the
wind doing?’ Nothing again nothing. ‘Do ‘You know nothing? Do
you see nothing? Do you remember ‘Nothing?’ I remember Those
are pearls that were his eyes. ‘Are you alive, or
not? Is there nothing in your head?’ But O O
O O that Shakespeherian Rag— It’s so elegant So intelligent
‘What shall I do now? What shall I do?’ ‘I
shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
‘With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?
‘What shall we ever do?’ The hot water at ten.
And if it rains, a closed car at four. And
we shall play a game of chess, Pressing lidless eyes
and waiting for a knock upon the door. When Lil’s
husband got demobbed, I said— I didn’t mince my words,
I said to her myself, HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart. He’ll
want to know what you done with that money he
gave you To get yourself some teeth. He did, I
was there. You have them all out, Lil, and get
a nice set, He said, I swear, I can’t bear
to look at you. And no more can’t I, I
said, and think of poor Albert, He’s been in the
army four years, he wants a good time, And if
you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give
me a straight look. HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME If
you don’t like it you can get on with it,
I said. Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack
of telling. You ought to be ashamed, I said, to
look so antique. (And her only thirty-one.) I can’t help
it, she said, pulling a long face, It’s them pills
I took, to bring it off, she said. (She’s had
five already, and nearly died of young George.) The chemist
said it would be all right, but I’ve never been
the same. You are a proper fool, I said. Well,
if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I
said, What you get married for if you don’t want
children? HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Well, that Sunday Albert
was home, they had a hot gammon, And they asked
me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it
hot— HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME HURRY UP PLEASE ITS
TIME Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight. Ta ta.
Goonight. Goonight. Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good
night, good night. III. The Fire Sermon The river’s tent
is broken: the last fingers of leaf Clutch and sink
into the wet bank. The wind Crosses the brown land,
unheard. The nymphs are departed. Sweet Thames, run softly, till
I end my song. The river bears no empty bottles,
sandwich papers, Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends Or other
testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. And their
friends, the loitering heirs of City directors; Departed, have left
no addresses. By the waters of Leman I sat down
and wept . . . Sweet Thames, run softly till
I end my song, Sweet Thames, run softly, for I
speak not loud or long. But at my back in
a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones,
and chuckle spread from ear to ear. A rat crept
softly through the vegetation Dragging its slimy belly on the
bank While I was fishing in the dull canal On
a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the
king my brother’s wreck And on the king my father’s
death before him. White bodies naked on the low damp
ground And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year. But
at my back from time to time I hear The
sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to
Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright
on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their
feet in soda water Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant
dans la coupole! Twit twit twit Jug jug jug jug

brown fog of a winter noon Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna
merchant Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants C.i.f. London:
documents at sight, Asked me in demotic French To luncheon
at the Cannon Street Hotel Followed by a weekend at
the Metropole. At the violet hour, when the eyes and
back Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine
waits Like a taxi throbbing waiting, I Tiresias, though blind,
throbbing between two lives, Old man with wrinkled female breasts,
can see At the violet hour, the evening hour that
strives Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The
typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove,
and lays out food in tins. Out of the window
perilously spread Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last
rays, On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. I Tiresias, old man with
wrinkled dugs Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest— I
too awaited the expected guest. He, the young man carbuncular,
arrives, A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,
One of the low on whom assurance sits As a
silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. The time is now
propitious, as he guesses, The meal is ended, she is
bored and tired, Endeavours to engage her in caresses Which
still are unreproved, if undesired. Flushed and decided, he assaults
at once; Exploring hands encounter no defence; His vanity requires
no response, And makes a welcome of indifference. (And I
Tiresias have foresuffered all Enacted on this same divan or
bed; I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
And walked among the lowest of the dead.) Bestows one
final patronising kiss, And gropes his way, finding the stairs
unlit . . . She turns and looks a moment
in the glass, Hardly aware of her departed lover; Her
brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: 'Well now that’s
done: and I’m glad it’s over.’ When lovely woman stoops
to folly and Paces about her room again, alone, She
smooths her hair with automatic hand, And puts a record
on the gramophone. ‘This music crept by me upon the
waters’ And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. O
City city, I can sometimes hear Beside a public bar
in Lower Thames Street, The pleasant whining of a mandoline
And a clatter and a chatter from within Where fishmen
lounge at noon: where the walls Of Magnus Martyr hold
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold. The river sweats
Oil and tar The barges drift With the turning tide
Red sails Wide To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
The barges wash Drifting logs Down Greenwich reach Past the
Isle of Dogs. Weialala leia Wallala leialala Elizabeth and Leicester
