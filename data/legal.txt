GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE (“LICENSE“). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. “LICENSED WORK” AND “RECIPIENT” ARE DEFINED BELOW.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This License is “adaptive”, and the generic version or another version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine your rights and obligations under this License. You must read the specific Adaptive Public License that you receive with the Licensed Work, as certain terms are defined at the outset by the Initial Contributor.

See Section 2.2 below, Exhibit A attached, and any Suppfile.txt accompanying this License to determine the specific adaptive features applicable to this License. For example, without limiting the foregoing, (a) for selected choice of law and jurisdiction see Part 3 of Exhibit A; (b) for the selected definition of Third Party see Part 4 of Exhibit A; and (c) for selected patent licensing terms (if any) see Section 2.2 below and Part 6 of Exhibit A.
