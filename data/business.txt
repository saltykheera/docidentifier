To whom it may concern:
Elon Musk�s takeover of Twitter will further toxify our information ecosystem 
and be a direct threat to public safety, especially among those already most 
vulnerable and marginalized.  
Twitter has outsized influence in shaping both public discourse and industry-
wide platform governance standards. While the company is hardly a poster-
child for healthy social media, it  has taken welcome steps in recent years to 
mitigate systemic risks, ratcheting up pressure on the likes of Facebook and 
YouTube to follow suit. Musk intends to steamroll those safeguards and provide 
a megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation, hate, and harassment. 
Under the guise of �free speech,� his vision will silence and endanger marginalized 
communities, and tear at the fraying fabric of democracy.
The undersigned organizations believe that Twitter should continue to uphold the 
practices that serve as guideposts for other Big Tech platforms. We call on you � 
Twitter�s top advertisers � to commit to these standards as non-negotiable 
requirements for advertising on the platform:
1. Keep accounts including those of public figures and politicians that were 
removed for egregious violations of Twitter Rules � such as harassment, 
violence, and hateful conduct � off the platform and continue to enforce 
the civic integrity policy along with the hateful conduct policy. Since 2020, 
Twitter has applied its civic integrity policy to all users, including elected 
officials. Musk�s statements at Ted2022 last week indicate that he will 
roll-back permanent bans and err on the side of allowing harmful content 
to remain on the platform under the guise of �free speech.� A reversal of 
Twitter�s content moderation policies including its recently released climate 
commitments, its protections for transgender people, and its restrictions on 
other forms of hate, harassment, and violence would be toxic not just for those 
targeted, but also for businesses advertising on the platform.
2. Beyond algorithmic transparency, ensure algorithmic accountability, 
preserve people�s privacy, and commit to depolarizing the algorithm. 
Consider the implications of full-scale public visibility into Twitter�s algorithm 
and put protections in place to prevent bad actors from gaming the system. 
Listen to privacy experts and others whose expertise includes protecting 
communities that are discriminated against in speaking truth to power.

its algorithms including published research, for instance, on whether the 
algorithms that automatically crop profile photos contained inadvertent bias.
3. Continue Twitter�s commitment to transparency and researcher access. 
Twitter stands out for its support of researchers � both internal and external 
to the company. From its API for academic research to its willingness to 
publish critique and its internal learnings, Twitter has demonstrated a 
commitment to transparency and access for researchers that sets an example 
for other Big Tech companies and allows for accountability.
As top advertisers on Twitter, your brand risks association with a platform 
amplifying hate, extremism, health misinformation, and conspiracy 
theorists. Under Musk�s management, Twitter risks becoming a cesspool of 
misinformation, with your brand attached, polluting our information ecosystem 
in a time where trust in institutions and news media is already at an all-time low.  
Your ad dollars can either fund Musk�s vanity project or hold him to account. We 
call on you to demand Musk uphold these basic standards of community trust 
and safety, and to pull your advertising spending from Twitter if they are not.
Sincerely,
